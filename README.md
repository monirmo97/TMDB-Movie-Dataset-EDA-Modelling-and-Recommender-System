# TMDB-Movie-Dataset-EDA-Modelling-and-Recommender-System
Overview:
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, aiming to gain insights into various aspects of the movie industry. Through thorough data exploration and analysis, we seek to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset, which includes information on movies such as titles, cast, crew, genres, budget, revenue, popularity, and runtime.

Dataset Description:
The TMDB dataset comprises two main CSV files: tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv. These files contain detailed information about thousands of movies, including their attributes and metadata. The dataset provides a rich source of data for analysis and exploration of the movie industry.

Project Objectives:
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of various features in the dataset.
Identify key factors influencing movie profitability, including budget, revenue, and audience engagement metrics.
Explore correlations between different attributes such as budget, revenue, popularity, and runtime.
Utilize machine learning techniques to predict movie profitability based on selected features.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the movie industry.

Project Steps:
1. Data Acquisition: Read and preprocess the TMDB dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and trends of various movie attributes.
3. Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may influence movie profitability and audience engagement.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Utilize machine learning models to predict movie profitability and evaluate model performance.
5. Insights and Recommendations: Summarize findings and provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the movie industry.
